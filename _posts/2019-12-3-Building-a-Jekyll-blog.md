title: TUTORIAL: Building a Jekyll blog with Github Pages
---

After procrastinating on starting a blog for years, this blog only took me 30 minutes to get started. I did have to spend some more time familiarizing myself with the specifics of Markdown (my prior knowledge is elementary) but this [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) includes all of the basics.

Based on this [tutorial](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/), I wrote a TLDR version below. Please do be sure to at least skim the tutorial as it includes tips I didn't include, useful pictures, and more optional steps. 

Directions
1. Fork the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) from GitHub

2. Rename your repository to *username.github.io*

   Note: Your site might not be published yet (it should be after step 3, or after commiting any changes within your repository)
   
3. Personalize the `_config.yml`

4. Edit `/_posts/2014-3-3-Hello-World.md` and update the date and title of your post.
   
   Note: Jekyll follows the following naming convention: `year-month-day-title.md`

DONE!
