The hard part isn't getting started. WHY DOES IT LOOK SO UGLY.

I tried to change the theme by following these [instructions](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/adding-a-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-with-the-theme-chooser) from the Github Help section, but it still looked exactly the same to me.

I had forked repo from barryclark/jekyll-now. Instead, follow these tutorials:
